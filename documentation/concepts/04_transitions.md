## Components of a Transition
An Aleo transition is serialized in the following format:

|    Parameter    |         Type         |                                                                        Description                                                                        |
|:---------------:|:--------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|      `id`       | finite field element |                         The transition id, which is computed via the Merkle tree digest formed from the `Input` and `Output` IDs                          |
|  `program_id`   |        string        |                          The program ID, which is associated with a verification key on a globally maintained map on the ledger.                          |
| `function_name` |        string        |                                    The function name, which is used to compute a `function_id` using the `program_id`.                                    |
|    `inputs`     |  array of `Input`s   |                                 The transition `Input`s, which can be a `constant`, `public`, `private`, or `inputRecord`                                 |
|    `outputs`    |  array of `Output`s  |                                The transition `Output`s, which can be a `constant`, `public`, `private`, or `outputRecord`                                |
|   `finalize`    |        array         |                                                                  The inputs for finalize                                                                  |
|      `tpk`      |    group element     |                    The transition public key, which is used to verify the digital signature provided by the `owner` in a `transaction`                    |
|      `tcm`      | finite field element |                                                                 The transition commitment                                                                 |

#### Input Record
An `inputRecord` is a tuple consisting of a `serial_number` and a `tag`. Recall that since the serial number is disclosed on the ledger, this publicly announces the record which is being spent. 
Recall that serial numbers are posted onto the ledger to announce that previously unspent records have now been spent. Each record has an associated `tag` which is used to keep track of records which are spendable by the user. A tag is computed via `tag` = CRH.Eval(`sk_tag`, `record_commitment`).

#### Output Record
An `outputRecord` consists of a `record_commitment`, `checksum`, an a `record_ciphertext`. A `record_commitment` is computed via Pedersen.Commit(`pp`, `apk` || `data` || `nonce` || `microcredits` ; r). The `record_encryption` is computed via SymmEnc.Eval(`pp`, `apk` || `data` || `nonce` || `microcredits` ; r) and the checksum, used to verify the integrity of the record commitment, is computed via `record_commitment` = CRH.Eval(`record_encryption`).
