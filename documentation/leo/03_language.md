### Statically Typed

Leo is a **statically typed language**, which means we must know the type of each variable before executing a circuit.

### Explicit Types Required

There is no `undefined` or `null` value in Leo. When assigning a new variable, **the type of the value must be
explicitly stated**.

<!-- The exception to this rule is when a new variable inherits its type from a previous variable. -->

### Pass by Value

Expressions in Leo are always **passed by value**, which means their values are always copied when they are used as
function inputs or in right sides of assignments.

## Data Types and Values

### Booleans

Leo supports the traditional `true` or `false` boolean values. The explicit `bool` type for booleans in statements is
required.

```leo
let b: bool = false;
```

### Integers

Leo supports signed integer types `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`
and unsigned integer types `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`.

```leo
let b: u8 = 1u8;
```

:::info
Higher bit length integers generate more constraints in the circuit, which can slow down computation time.
:::

#### A Note on Leo Integers

Leo will not default to an integer type. The definition of a integer **must** include an explicit type.  
**Type casting is supported as of Leo v1.8.2**

```leo
let a: u8 = 2u8; // explicit type
let b: u16 = a as u16; // type casting
let b: u8 = 2; // implicit type -- not supported
```

### Field Elements

Leo supports the `field` type for the base field elements of the elliptic curve.
These are unsigned integers below the modulus of the base field.

```leo
let a: field = 1field;
let b: field = 21888242871839275222246405745257275088548364400416034343698204186575808495617field;
```

### Group Elements

The set of affine points on the elliptic curve passed into the Leo compiler forms a group.
Leo supports a subgroup of this group, generated by a generator point, as a primitive data type.
Group elements are special since their values can be defined from the x-coordinate of a coordinate pair, such as
`0group`. The group type keyword `group` must be used when specifying a group value.

```leo
let b: group = 0group; // the point with 0 x-coordinate
```

The aforementioned generator point can be obtained via a constant associated to the `group` type.

```leo
let g: group = group::GEN; // the group generator
```

### Scalar Elements

Leo supports the `scalar` type for scalar field elements of the elliptic curve subgroup.
These are unsigned integers below the modulus of the scalar field.

```leo
let a: scalar = 1scalar;
```

### Addresses

Addresses are defined to enable compiler-optimized routines for parsing and operating over addresses.
These semantics will be accompanied by a standard library in a future sprint.

```leo
let receiver: address = aleo1ezamst4pjgj9zfxqq0fwfj8a4cjuqndmasgata3hggzqygggnyfq6kmyd4;
```

## Layout of a Leo Program

A Leo program contains declarations of a [Program Scope](#program-scope), [Imports](#import)
, [Transition Functions](#transition-function), [Helper Functions](#helper-function), [Structs](#struct)
, [Records](#record),
[Mappings](#mapping), and [Finalize Functions](#finalize).
Declarations are locally accessible within a program file.
If you need a declaration from another Leo file, you must import it.

### Program Scope

A program scope in the sense of Leo is a collection of code (its functions) and data (its types) that resides at a
[program ID](#program-id) on the Aleo blockchain.

```leo
import foo.leo;

program hello.aleo {
    mapping balances: address => u64;

    record token {
        owner: address,
        microcredits: u64,
        amount: u64,
    }

    struct message {
        sender: address,
        object: u64,
    }

    transition mint_public(
        public receiver: address,
        public amount: u64,
    ) -> token {
        return token {
            owner: receiver,
            microcredits: 0u64,
            amount,
        } then finalize(receiver, amount);
    }

    finalize mint_public(
        public receiver: address,
        public amount: u64,
    ) {
        let current_amount: u64 = Mapping::get_or_use(account, receiver, 0u64);
        Mapping::set(account, receiver, current_amount + amount);
   }

    function compute(a: u64, b: u64) -> u64 {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

The following must be declared inside the program scope in a Leo file:

- mappings
- record types
- struct types
- transition functions
- helper functions
- finalize functions

The following must be declared outside the program scope in a Leo file:

- imports

#### Program ID

A program ID is declared as `{name}.{network}`.
The first character of a `name` must be lowercase.
`name` can contain lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores.
Currently, `aleo` is the only supported `network` domain.

```leo showLineNumbers
program hello.aleo; // valid

program Foo.aleo;   // invalid
program baR.aleo;   // invalid
program 0foo.aleo;  // invalid
program 0_foo.aleo; // invalid
program _foo.aleo;  // invalid
```

### Import

You can import dependencies that are downloaded to the `imports` directory.
An import is declared as `import {filename}.leo;`
This will look for `imports/{filename}.leo` and bring all declarations into the current file scope.
If there are duplicate names for declarations, Leo will fail to compile.
Ordering is enforced for imports, which must be at the top of file.

:::caution
Leo imports are unstable and currently only provide minimal functionality.
Their syntax is expected to change.
:::

```leo showLineNumbers
import foo.leo; // Import all `foo.leo` declarations into the `hello.aleo` program.

program hello.aleo { }
```

### Struct

A struct data type is declared as `struct {name} {}`.
Structs contain component declarations `{name}: {type},`.

```leo showLineNumbers
struct array3 {
    a0: u32,
    a1: u32,
    a2: u32,
}
```

### Record

A [record](../concepts/02_records.md) data type is declared as `record {name} {}`.
Records contain component declarations `{visibility} {name}: {type},`.

A visibility can be either `constant`, `public`, or `private`.
Users may also omit the visibility, in which case, Leo will default to `private`.

Record data structures must contain the `owner` and `microcredits` components as shown below.
When passing a record as input to a program function, the `_nonce: group` component is also required
(but it does not need to be declared in the Leo program).

```aleo showLineNumbers
record token {
    // The token owner.
    owner: address,
    // The Aleo balance (in microcredits).
    microcredits: u64,
    // The token amount.
    amount: u64,
}
```

### Transition Function

Transition functions in Leo are declared as `transition {name}() {}`.
Transition functions can be called directly when running a Leo program (via `leo run`).
Transition functions contain expressions and statements that can compute values.
Transition functions must be in a program's current scope to be called.

```leo showLineNumbers
program hello.aleo {
    transition foo(
        public a: field,
        b: field,
    ) -> field {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

#### Function Inputs

A function input is declared as `{visibility} {name}: {type},`
Function inputs must be declared just after the function name declaration, in parentheses.

```leo showLineNumbers
// The transition function `foo` takes a single input `a` with type `field` and visibility `public`.
transition foo(public a: field) { }
```

#### Function Outputs

A function output is calculated as `return {expression};`.
Returning an output ends the execution of the function.
The return type of the function declaration must match the type of the returned `{expression}`.

```leo showLineNumbers
transition foo(public a: field) -> field {
    // Returns the addition of the public input a and the value `1field`.
    return a + 1field;
}
```

### Helper Function

A helper function is declared as `function {name}() {}`.
Helper functions contain expressions and statements that can compute values,
however helper functions cannot produce `records`.

Helper functions cannot be called directly from the outside. Instead, they must be called by other functions.
Inputs of helper functions cannot have `{visibility}` modifiers like transition functions,
since they are used only internally, not as part of a program's external interface.

```leo showLineNumbers
function foo(
    a: field,
    b: field,
) -> field {
    return a + b;
}
```

### Inline Function

An inline function is declared as `inline {name}() {}`.
Inline functions contain expressions and statements that can compute values.
Inline functions cannot be executed directly from the outside,
instead the Leo compiler inlines the body of the function at each call site.

Inputs of inline functions cannot have `{visibility}` modifiers like transition functions,
since they are used only internally, not as part of a program's external interface.

```leo showLineNumbers
inline foo(
    a: field,
    b: field,
) -> field {
    return a + b;
}
```

The rules for functions (in the traditional sense) are as follows:

- There are three variants of functions: transition, function, inline.
- transitions can only call functions and inlines.
- functions can only call inlines.
- inlines can only call inlines.
- Direct/indirect recursive calls are not allowed

### Finalize Function

A finalize function is declared as `finalize {name}:`.
A finalize function must immediately follow a [transition function](#transition-function), and must have the same name;
it is associated with the transition function and is executed on chain,
after the zero-knowledge proof of the execution of the associated transition is verified;
a finalize function _finalizes_ a transition function on chain.
Upon success of the finalize function, the program logic is executed.
Upon failure of the finalize function, the program logic is reverted.

```leo showLineNumbers
program transfer.aleo {
    // The function `transfer_public_to_private` turns a specified token amount
    // from `account` into a token record for the specified receiver.
    //
    // This function preserves privacy for the receiver's record, however
    // it publicly reveals the caller and the specified token amount.
    transition transfer_public_to_private(
        public receiver: address,
        public amount: u64
    ) -> token {
        // Produce a token record for the token receiver.
        let new: token = token {
            owner: receiver,
            microcredits: 0u64,
            amount,
        };

        // Return the receiver's record, then decrement the token amount of the caller publicly.
        return new then finalize(self.caller, amount);
    }

    finalize transfer_public_to_private(
        public sender: address,
        public amount: u64
    ) {
        // Decrements `account[sender]` by `amount`.
        // If `account[sender]` does not exist, it will be created.
        // If `account[sender] - amount` underflows, `transfer_public_to_private` is reverted.
        let current_amount: u64 = Mapping::get_or_use(account, sender, 0u64);
        Mapping::set(account, sender, current_amount - amount);
    }
}
```



### Mapping

A mapping is declared as `mapping {name}: {key-type} => {value-type}`.
Mappings contain key-value pairs.
Mappings are stored on chain.

```leo showLineNumbers
// On-chain storage of an `account` mapping,
// with `address` as the type of keys,
// and `u64` as the type of values.
mapping account: address => u64;
```

#### Mapping Operations

The mapping struct allows the programmer to apply updates to a program mapping data structure by calling one of the
following functions. 

:::info
Mapping operations are only allowed in a [finalize function](#finalize-function).
:::

```leo showLineNumbers
program test.aleo {
    mapping counter: address => u64;

    transition dubble() {
        return then finalize(self.caller);
    }

    finalize dubble(addr: address) {
        let current_value: u64 = Mapping::get_or_use(counter, addr, 0u64);
        Mapping::set(counter, addr, current_value + 1u64);
        current_value = Mapping::get(counter, addr);
        Mapping::set(counter, addr, current_value + 1u64);
    }

}
```

#### get

A get command, e.g. `current_value = Mapping::get(counter, addr);`
Gets the value stored at `addr` in `counter` and stores the result in `current_value`
If the value at `addr` does not exist, then the program will fail to execute.

#### get_or_use

A get command that uses the provided default in case of failure,  
e.g. `let current_value: u64 = Mapping::get_or_use(counter, addr, 0u64);`  
Gets the value stored at `addr` in `counter` and stores the result in `current_value`.
If the key is not present, `0u64` is stored in `counter` and stored in `current_value`.

#### set

A set command, e.g. `Mapping::set(counter, addr, current_value + 1u64);`
Sets the `addr` entry as `current_value + 1u64` in `counter`.

#### contains

A contains command, e.g. `let contains: bool = Mapping::contains(counter, addr);`
Returns `true` if `addr` is present in `counter`, `false` otherwise.

#### remove

A remove command, e.g. `Mapping::remove(counter, addr);`
Removes the entry at `addr` in `counter`.

## For Loops

For Loops are declared as `for {variable: type} in {lower bound}..{upper bound}`. Unsigned integer
types `u8`, `u16`, and `u32` are recommended for loop variable types. The lower bound must be
less than the upper bound. Nested loops are supported.

### Example

```leo
  let count: u32 = 0u32;

  for i: u32 in 0u32..5u32 {
    count += 1u32;
  }

  return count; // returns 5u32
```

## Operators

Operators in Leo compute a value based off of one or more expressions.
Leo will try to detect arithmetic operation errors as soon as possible.
If an integer overflow or division by zero can be identified at compile time, Leo will quickly tell the programmer.
Otherwise, the error will be caught at proving time when transition function inputs are processed.

For instance, addition adds `first` with `second`, storing the outcome in `destination`.
For integer types, a constraint is added to check for overflow.
For cases where wrapping semantics are needed for integer types, see the `Add Wrapped` operator.

```leo
let a: u8 = 1u8 + 1u8;
// a is equal to 2

a += 1u8;
// a is now equal to 3

a = a.add(1u8);
// a is now equal to 4
```

### Operator Precedence

Operators will prioritize evaluation according to:

|                                     `**`                                      | right to left |
|                                    `*` `/`                                    | left to right |
|                                `+` `-`(binary)                                | left to right |
|                                   `<<` `>>`                                   | left to right |
|                                      `&`                                      | left to right |
|                              <code>&#124;</code>                              | left to right |
|                                      `^`                                      | left to right |

|                                   `==` `!=`                                   | left to right |
|                                     `&&`                                      | left to right |
|                           <code>&#124;&#124;</code>                           | left to right |
| `=` `+=` `-=` `*=` `/=` `%=` `**=` `<<=` `>>=` `&=` <code>&#124;=</code> `^=` |               |

### Parentheses

To prioritize a different evaluation, use parentheses `()` around the expression.

```leo
let result = (a + 1u8) * 2u8;
```

`(a + 1u8)` will be evaluated before multiplying by two `* 2u8`.

## Commands

Leo supports several commands that can be used to reference information about the Aleo blockchain and the current transaction.

### self.caller

Returns the address of the account that is calling the program function.

```leo showLineNumbers
program test.aleo {
    transition matches(addr: address) -> bool {
        return self.caller == addr;
    }
}
```

### block.height
Returns the height of the current block.

:::info
`block.height` is only allowed in a [finalize function](#finalize-function).
:::

```leo showLineNumbers
program test.aleo {
    transition matches(height: u32) {
        return then finalize(height);
    } finalize matches(height: u32) {
        assert_eq(height, block.height);
    }
}
```

## Core Functions

Core functions are functions that are built into the Leo language.
They are used to perform cryptographic operations such as hashing, commitment, and random number generation.

### Assert and AssertEq

`assert` and `assert_eq` are used to verify that a condition is true.
If the condition is false, the program will fail.

```leo showLineNumbers
program test.aleo {
    transition matches() {
        assert(true);
        assert_eq(1u8, 1u8);
    }
}
```

### Hash

Leo supports the following hashing algorithms: `BHP256`, `BHP512`, `BHP768`, `BHP1024`, `Pedersen64`, `Pedersen128`, `Poseidon2`, `Poseidon4`, `Poseidon8`  
The output type of a commitment function is specified in the function name. e.g. `hash_to_group` will return a `group` type.
Hash functions take any type as an argument.

```leo showLineNumbers
let a: scalar = BHP256::hash_to_scalar(1u8);
let b: address = Pedersen64::hash_to_address(1u128);
let c: group = Poseidon2::hash_to_group(1field);
```
[See all hash functions](./04_operators.md#table-of-cryptographic-operators)

### Commit

Leo supports the following commitment algorithms: `BHP256`, `BHP512`, `BHP768`, `BHP1024`, `Pedersen64`, `Pedersen128`  
The output type of a commitment function is specified in the function name. e.g. `commit_to_group` will return a `group` type.  
The first argument can be any type. The second argument must be a `field` type and is used as a blinding factor.

```leo showLineNumbers
let a: group = BHP256::commit_to_group(1u8, 2field);
let b: address = Pedersen64::commit_to_address(1u128, 2field);
```

[See all commitment functions](./04_operators.md#table-of-cryptographic-operators)

### Random

Leo supports the `ChaCha` random number generation algorithm.  
The output type of a random function is specified in the function name. e.g. `rand_group` will return a `group` type.  

:::info
Random functions are only allowed in a [finalize function](#finalize-function).
:::

```leo showLineNumbers
let a: group = ChaCha::rand_group();
let b: u32 = ChaCha::rand_u32();
```

[See all random functions](./04_operators.md#table-of-cryptographic-operators)

## Deprecated Syntax

#### Increment and Decrement

`increment()` and `decrement()` functions are deprecated as of Leo v1.7.0.
Please use the [`Mapping::set()`](#set) function instead.

```leo showLineNumbers
program transfer.aleo {
    // On-chain storage of an `account` map,
    // with `address` as the key,
    // and `u64` as the value.
    mapping account: address => u64;

    transition transfer_public(...) {...}

    finalize transfer_public(
        public sender: address,
        public receiver: address,
        public amount: u64
    ) {
        // Decrements `account[sender]` by `amount`.
        // If `account[sender]` does not exist, it will be created.
        // If `account[sender] - amount` underflows, `transfer_public` is reverted.
        let sender_amount: u64 = Mapping::get_or_use(account, sender, 0u64);
        Mapping::set(account, sender, sender_amount - amount);

        // Increments `account[receiver]` by `amount`.
        // If `account[receiver]` does not exist, it will be created.
        // If `account[receiver] + amount` overflows, `transfer_public` is reverted.
        let receiver_amount: u64 = Mapping::get_or_use(account, receiver, 0u64);
        Mapping::set(account, receiver, receiver_amount + amount);
    }
}
```
