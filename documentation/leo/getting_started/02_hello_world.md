Use the Leo CLI to create a new project.
In your terminal, run:
```bash
leo new hello
cd hello
```

This creates a directory with the following structure:

```bash
hello/
├── program.json # Your program manifest
├── README.md # Your program description
├── inputs/ 
│ ├── hello.in # Your program inputs
└── src/    
  └── main.leo # Your program file
```

Let's run the project.

## Zero Knowledge in one line

The `leo run` command will compile and execute the program.
In your terminal, run:
```bash
leo run main
```

```bash title="console output:"
