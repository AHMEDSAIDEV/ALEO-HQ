title: File Syntax

First, open your **hello** project in [Aleo Studio](https://aleo.studio/) (for pretty syntax highlighting) or your text editor of choice. 

**program.json** is the Leo manifest file that configures our package. 
```json title="program.json" 
{
    "program": "hello.aleo",
    "version": "0.0.0",
    "description": "",
    "development": {
        "private_key": "APrivateKey1zkp2VZTNU45XjpcRDbe5yg3b5L7XVvB4zrFPtw1NAYvmhJx",
        "address": "aleo15egrwaxaherd70ca0aln3th7ry7dmtfeggf8jm3saxeddpa6dsqsye9u3m"
    },
    "license": "MIT"
}
```

The program id `program` is the official name that other developers will be able to look up after you have published your program.
```json
    "program": "hello.aleo",
```

All files in the current package will be compiled with the specified Leo `version`. 

```json
    "version": "0.0.0",
```

## Syntax to circuits
Open up **src/main.leo**.
The **main.leo** file is the entry point of a Leo project. It often contains a function named `main`. 
Let's break down the structure of a Leo file.
```leo title="src/main.leo" showLineNumbers
// The 'hello' main function.
program hello.aleo {
    transition main(public a: u32, b: u32) -> u32 {
        let c: u32 = a + b;
        return c;
    }
}
```

`program hello.aleo {` defines the name of the [program](../language/01_language.md#program-scope) inside the Leo file. 
The program ID must match the `program.json` manifest file.  
The keyword `transition` indicates a [transition](../language/01_language.md#transition-function) function definition in Leo. 
Our **hello** `main` function takes an input `a` with type `u32` and `public` visibility and an input `b` with type `u32` and `private` visibility by default.
The program returns one result with type `u32`.
The transition function body is enclosed in curly braces `{ }`. It is a common convention in Leo to place the opening curly 
bracket on the same line as the function definition, adding one space in between.
```leo
transition main(public a: u32, b: u32) -> u32 {
```

Inside the `main` function we declare a variable `c` with type `u32` and set it equal to the addition of variables `a` and `b`.
Leo's compiler will check that the types of `a` and `b` are equal and that the result of the addition is type `u32`.
```leo
let c: u32 = a + b;
```

:::info
We designed Leo with the belief that developers are human and can make mistakes.
Try changing the type of any variable and seeing what Leo recommends with helpful error messages.
:::

Last, we return the variable `c`.
Leo will check that `c`'s type matches the function return type `u32`.
```leo
return c;
```

## Wiring program inputs 
Leo's compiler will build a **circuit** out of the **main.leo** program. Open up **inputs/hello.in**.
Files ending in **.in** provide inputs to the program. You can also specify program arguments via the [command line](../cli/03_run.md).
```leo title="inputs/hello.in"
// The program input for hello/src/main.leo
[main]
public a: u32 = 1u32;
b: u32 = 2u32;
```

An input file begins with a section enclosed in brackets `[ ]`.
`main` indicates that we are defining the inputs to the program function `main`.
You can only define inputs to [transition functions](../language/01_language.md#transition-function).

```leo
[main]
```

An input assignment shares syntax with an explicit variable assignment in normal `.leo` files.
Here we assign the `public` input named `a` with type `u32` to the value `1`. Leo's compiler will fetch these values and provide them as inputs to the circuit at proving time.

```leo
public a: u32 = 1u32;
b: u32 = 2u32;
```

Now lets look into the Leo CLI and see what commands we can run on our program.
