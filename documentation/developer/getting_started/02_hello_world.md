Use the Leo CLI to create a new project.
In your terminal, run:
```bash
leo new hello-world
cd hello-world
```

This creates a directory with the following structure:

```bash
hello-world/
├── Leo.toml # Your program manifest
├── inputs/ 
│ └── hello-world.in # Your program inputs
└── src/    
  └── main.leo # Your program file
```

Let's run the project.

## Zero Knowledge in one line

The `leo run` command will compile the program, generate keys for a trusted setup, fetch inputs, generate a proof and verify it.
In your terminal, run:
```bash
leo run
```

```bash title="console output:"
  leo  Compiled program file "/$PATH/hello-world/src/main.leo"
  leo  Setup starting...
  leo  Program circuit successfully synthesized!

Congratulations! You've just run your first Leo program.

Let's go through the file syntax of the program we just executed.
