title: The Leo Programming Model
sidebar_label: Model

This section assumes that you have knowledge of [records](../../aleo/concepts/02_records.md) and their use in the [Aleo Protocol](../../aleo/concepts/00_accounts.md).

## Leo Record Runtime

Each Leo `.leo` file is compiled into [program](../../aleo/concepts/06_glossary.md#program).
Each program lives in a [record](../../aleo/concepts/02_records.md). Each record lives in a [transaction](../../aleo/concepts/03_transactions.md).
An Aleo transaction spends two old records: `old_record_0`, `old_record_1` and creates two new records: `new_record_0`, `new_record_1`.

## Registers

A register stores intermediate record state during runtime.
During runtime, we load an initial input state into a record and expect and output state after the record is run.

* Input state is stored in the input register.
* Output state is stored in the output register.

```leo
input_register -> record -> output_register
```

Leo executes each record in order:

1. `state_0 -> old_record_0 -> state_1`
2. `state_1 -> old_record_1 -> state_2`
3. `state_2 -> new_record_0 -> state_3`
4. `state_3 -> new_record_1 -> state_4`

To ensure the accuracy of input and output register state, a hash of each is stored in the local data commitment for each record. 

## Committing to Register Data.

Register values are hashed and included in the [local data commitment](../../aleo/concepts/03_transactions.md#local-data-commitment).
The Leo runtime calculates the [record commitment](../../aleo/concepts/06_glossary.md#record-commitment) as well as 
the local data commitment to ensure that all record data is included in the [local data root](../../aleo/concepts/03_transactions.md#ledger-digest).

## `.in` and `.out` files

### Input Registers

Input register information is passed to Leo as program input inside the `.in` file indicated by the `[registers]` [section](../language/07_inputs.md#runtime-input-registers).

```leo title="project.in"
[main]
data: u8[32] = [0u8; 32];

[registers]
token_id: u8[32] = [0u8; 32];
value_balance: u64 = 0;
```

### Accessing Input Registers

Input register values can be accessed by passing the `registers` section into the `main` function of a Leo file and
accessing each variable via dot `.` syntax.

```leo
function main(data: u8[32], registers) {
    let a = registers.value_balance + 5;

    assert_eq!(registers.token_id, data);
}
``` 

### Output Registers

Output register information is stored inside the `.out` file indicated by the `[registers]` section.

```leo title="project.out"
[registers]
token_id: u8[32] = [0u8; 32];
value_balance: u64 = 0;
```

### Writing to Output Registers

The return function of main will automatically write to the output registers in `.out`.

### Reading from Output Registers

Intermediate runtime state will automatically be passed from one record's output register to the next record's input register.

## State

Leo files can access record and leaf state passed into the state file. 
For example, it could be necessary for Leo programs to access the [owner](../../aleo/concepts/02_records.md#owner), [value](../../aleo/concepts/02_records.md#value), or other private fields within a [record](../../aleo/concepts/02_records.md). 
This context is included in the state `.state` file.

## `.state` file

State information generated by the current Leo runtime is placed in the `.state` file.

```leo title="project.state"
[[public]]

[state]
leaf_index: u32 = 0;
root: u8[32] = [0u8; 32];

[[private]]

[record]
serial_number: u8[32] = [0u8; 32];
commitment: u8[32] = [0u8; 32];
owner: address = aleo1...;
value: u64 = 5;
payload: u8[32] = [0u8; 32];
birth_program_id: u8[32] = [0u8; 32];
death_program_id: u8[32] = [0u8; 32];
serial_number_nonce: u8[32] = [0u8; 32];
commitment_randomness: u8[32] = [0u8; 32];

[state_leaf]
path: u8[32][2] = [ [0u8; 32], [0u8; 32] ];
memo: u8[32] = [0u8; 32];
network_id: u8 = 0;
leaf_randomness: u8[32] = [0u8; 32];
```

### Public and Private Sections

A double bracket `[[public]]` or `[[private]]` section specifies whether sections below define public or private variables.
Developers **cannot** define public variables outside of the state `leaf_index` and `root`.

### Public State Variables

The `[state]` section defines the [local data root](../../aleo/concepts/03_transactions.md#local-data-root) and 
the current record's index (0 - 3) within the commitment (4 records in a [transaction](../../aleo/concepts/03_transactions.md) currently).
The state section must be defined below the public `[[public]]` section.

### Record Variables

The `[record]` section defines [record](../../aleo/concepts/02_records.md) information. All record variables are private 
so the record section must be defined below the private `[[private]]` section.

### Private State Leaf Variables

The `[state_leaf]` section defines state leaf transition information that is encoded in a [transaction](../../aleo/concepts/03_transactions.md).
The state leaf section must be defined below the private `[[private]]` section.

## Where Register and State Files are Stored

The Leo [CLI](../cli/00_new.md) creates an `inputs/` and an `outputs/` folder to store program input and output information from the compiler.
These folders also provide access to register, record, and leaf state information.
We already introduced the program [inputs](../language/07_inputs.md) `.in` file located in the `inputs/` folder.
When each Leo file in a transaction is run, `.out` files as well as a `.state` file are created as follows:

```bash
project/
├── Leo.toml
│
├── inputs/
│ ├── project.in
│ └── project.state
│
├── outputs/
│ └── project.out
│ 
└── src/    
  └── main.leo
```

## Accessing State File Variables

State register values can be accessed by passing the `state`, `record`, and `state_leaf` sections into the `main` function of a Leo file and
accessing each variable via dot `.` syntax.

```leo
function main(input) {
    let index = input.state.index;
    
    assert_eq!(input.record.value_balance, 0u64);

    assert_eq!(input.state_leaf.network_id, 1u8);
}
``` 

To see how to access registers and state variables in an application, lets walk through a familiar example of transferring an [ERC20 token](aleo/documentation/developer/programming_model/01_token.md) on Aleo.
