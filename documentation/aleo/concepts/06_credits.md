title: Aleo Credits

Aleo credits are the currency used within Aleo. 

Aleo credits are stored and transferred through [records](02_records.md) via transactions. 
Additionally, because all transactions on Aleo are fully private by default, 
the ownership and amounts of Aleo credits being transferred is never revealed to the network.

### Denominations

Aleo credits are divisible down to 6 decimal places of precision. The two denominations are Bytes and Gates, which
represent a millionth and a thousandth of an ALEO, respectively. 

 Below is a list of the named denominations and their value in ALEO. 

| Denomination | Abbreviation | Value in ALEO |
|:------------:|:------------:|:-------------:|
|     Byte     |      AB      | 0.000001 ALEO |
|     Gate     |      AG      |   0.001 ALEO  |
|     Aleo     |     ALEO     |     1 ALEO    |


There is no limit to the amount of Aleo credits in the network, but the total circulating supply is 
dictated by [block rewards](05_consensus.md#block-rewards).
