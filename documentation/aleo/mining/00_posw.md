Proof of Succinct Work (PoSW) is a consensus protocol that generates proofs on system validity as
a useful byprocess of performing Proof-of-Work.
The encoded predicate verifies the transactions that will be included in a given block update,
while ensuring that the underlying proof computation is still a time-lock puzzle.

## Overview

PoSW is a variant of Bitcoin's SHA-based difficulty adjusting algorithm,
with the key difference being that the underlying computation is not an arbitrary hash function
but rather a proof of knowledge. This allows the PoSW solution to not only act as PoW to ensure system consensus,
but also provide verification of transaction inclusion in a given block.
We work in the asynchronous model, and presume existence of an honest majority of miners (or provers). 

Given a Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge proof tuple $(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P},\mathcal{V})$
for a given relation $\mathcal{R}$, the PoSW algorithm consists of the following:

1. Given a set of (valid) transactions $T_i = \{t_1, ..., t_n\}$ and a current state $\mathsf{state}_i$, calculate $\mathsf{NewState}(\mathsf{state}_i, T_i) \rightarrow (\mathsf{state}_{i+1}, w_{i+1})$ where:
	- $\mathsf{state}_i$ is the state at the $i$-th block, and
	- $w_i$ is auxiliary information attesting to the validity of $\mathsf{state}_{i+1}.$

2. Sample a random nonce $n$ and compute: $$ \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{crs}, \langle n,  \mathsf{state}_{i+1} \rangle, w_{i+1}) \rightarrow \pi_n.$$

3. If $\mathsf{PRF}(\pi_n) \leq d$, set $n_{i+1} = n$ and $\pi_{i + 1} = \pi_n$. Return to Step 2 otherwise.

The function $\mathsf{PRF}$ is a pseudorandom function used to evaluate the difficulty condition,
while $\mathbf{crs}$ is the public output of $\mathcal{G}$.

### Difficulty Update

The difficulty update procedure resembles that of Bitcoin and other PoW currencies,
updating $d$ adaptively based on network hashrate.
It is iteratively updated based on the maximal and current targets every fixed number of blocks
and guarantees constant block time.

## Consensus Security

Since PoSW needs to satisfy PoW guarantees,
it requires security properties that make it a time-lock puzzle.
We identify these below.

### Amortization Resistance

The most important property of any PoW system is non-batchability:
computation of many instances of the problem should not provide substantial speed-ups to miners through the reuse of information.

We work in the Generic Group Model (GGM),
where miners have access to an oracle $\mathcal{O}$ performing a given hard computation
in the random encoding of some group $\mathbb{G}$.
Computational difficulty is then given by the number of oracle queries that a miner
makes to $\mathcal{O}$. In this setup, we can define the notion of $\epsilon$-*amortization resistance*
as the ratio of oracle queries performed by the optimal algorithm $\mathcal{A}^{\mathcal{O}}_{\mathcal{P}, \ell(n)}$ computing $\ell(n) = \mathsf{poly}(n)$ proofs simultaneously vs. the algorithm $\mathcal{A}^{\mathcal{O}}_{\mathcal{P}, 1}$ computing each $\ell(n)$ proof individually. Here $n$ is proof size, $\mathsf{Queries}(\mathcal{A}^{\mathcal{O}})$ the number of queries $\mathcal{A}^{\mathcal{O}}$ makes to $\mathcal{O}$ and $\mathbf{x}_i$ the (randomly sampled) $i$-th problem instance: $$ \epsilon \leq 1 - \frac{\mathsf{Queries}(\mathcal{A}^{\mathcal{O}}_{\mathcal{P}, \ell(n)}(\{\mathbf{x_i}\}_{i = 1}^{\ell(n)}))}{\sum_{i = 1}^{\ell(n)} \mathsf{Queries}(\mathcal{A}^{\mathcal{O}}_{\mathcal{P}, 1}(\mathbf{x_i}))}.$$

Intuitively, $\epsilon$ is the advantage that a large miner receives due to the amortizability of the underlying puzzle. If $\epsilon = 0$, no algorithm attains speedup from batching and the puzzle is *perfectly amortizable*. 

### Quantization Error \& Forking Probability

Unlike other PoW schemes, the repeated underlying computation in PoSW takes substantially more time to compute a potential solution (a single proof) than other puzzles. This is because NIZK proof generation is computationally intensive, which can have an effect on the security of the underlying chain if it's comparable to block generation time.

#### Quantization Error
 In the setting where proof generation time is a significant fraction of the block time, a slow miner who hears of a new solution before finishing their current attempt will have to discard partially-computed proofs to begin mining on the new block. We call the proportion of work wasted due to this the *quantization error* $\epsilon_Q$ of the protocol, which is equal to: $$ \epsilon_Q = 1 - \frac{\tau}{e^{\tau} - 1},$$ where block time is normalized to $1$ and average proof generation time is set to $\tau$.

Note that $\tau \rightarrow 0$ implies $\epsilon_Q \rightarrow 0$. In this limit, the work discarded by miners approaches zero, demonstrating that the ratio $r = \tau_p/\tau_b$ between proof generation time $\tau_p$ and block time $\tau_b$ should be minimized.

#### Forking Probability

The quantum effects observed above can also increase the number of observed collisions in the protocol. A conservative upper bound on this
can be obtained from a worst-case analysis of synchronized miners with identical proving time $\tau$, maximizing the probability of simultaneous solutions. If miners aren’t synchronized, they may opt to finish their current effort after a block is found (rather than discard partial work), but even if all miners do so this reduces to the synchronous case above.

The expected number of solutions in a mining “round” is a random variable $X \sim \mathsf{Po}(\tau)$. We can obtain a bound on the forking probability $\epsilon_F$ from the ratio of rounds with multiple solutions to rounds with any solution: $$ \epsilon_F \leq \frac{1 - \mathsf{Poisson}(1, \tau)}{1 - \mathsf{Poisson}(0, \tau)} \leq \frac{\tau}{2},$$ where $f(q) = \mathsf{Poisson}(q,\tau)$ the PDF of $X$. 

For a fixed block time, this means that any improvements in proving time (due to hardware acceleration and/or circuit size changes) will proportionally decrease this error bound.

## Instantiation

Below we provide the design choices of the PoSW implementation that achieve the above security guarantees, alongside the relevant security parameters.

### Proof System Choice

The choice of proof system is necessary (but not sufficient) in achieving amortization resistance, for the protocol. Although a variety of proof systems can be chosen, there are specific properties that need to be satisfied. PoSW uses the Marlin architecture, which is consistent with the properties below in the non-interactive Random Oracle setting.

#### Simulation Extractability
A simulation-extractable (SE) proof system has a unique encoding for every valid instance-witness pair $\langle \phi, w\rangle.$ This implies that valid proofs cannot be rerandomized without explicit knowledge of a different witness for $\phi$. Otherwise, an adversarial prover would be able to change the encoding of a proof after computation until it satisfies difficulty, which would violate the non-amortization requirement.

#### Reduction to an Average-Case Hard Problem

A non-amortizable prover should reduce in difficulty to a problem known (or postulated) to be non-batchable (or 'hard') on average. Since the state-of-the-art proof systems are almost all built using Kate commitments, we work in this paradigm and reduce proof computation to the problem of multi-exponentiation of a set of given (random) bases $\{G_i\}_{i = 1}^m \in \mathbb{G}^m$ by a set of random indices $\{x_i\}_{i  =1}^m \in \mathbb{Z}_p^m$. In this problem, hardness is measured in the number of queries to a multiplication oracle $\mathcal{O}_m$ in the given group's encoding.

Although the above problem is *not* non-amortizable in the setting of unbounded space, it can be shown to be non-amortizable on average for miners with a fixed size precomputation string.

### Predicate Design

The choice of predicate is also crucial in ensuring the above security guarantees. Below we identify the relevant properties that the computed relation $\mathcal{R}$ should satisfy:

1. **Usefulness:** The proof is a proof of knowledge for a statement providing inherent value to the protocol. We opt for a relation that verifies the inclusion of a set of transactions in the given block.

2. **Computational Uniqueness:** An adversary cannot find a new witness $w_2$ for $\phi$ given knowledge of a valid instance-witness pair $\langle \phi, w\rangle$. This ensures that the miner cannot resample witnesses for $\phi$ to reduce computational burden.

3. **Non-Amortization:** Valid witnesses for $\mathcal{R}$ need to "look" sufficiently random to reduce to the average-case hardness of multiexponentiation. The chosen predicate achieves $\epsilon = 0$ (or perfect) non-amortization in this context.


### Error Bounds

We set the desirable error bounds for quantization and forking error to $3\%$ and $1.5\%$ respectively. For a protocol with $1$-minute block times, this implies that average proof generation times need to be upper bounded by $\tau = 1.8 \approx 2$ seconds.
